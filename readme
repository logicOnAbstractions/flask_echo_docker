about
-----------------

a basic flask-server demo (2 servers) that echo each others on a docker network

structure
----------------

#. flask-1 server
#. flask-2 server


interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*. if either server is ping, it logs the ping it receives & also pings the other server
*. the other server logs the ping from the other server (but doesn't re-ping to avoid infinite pings loop)
*. if the ping includes an argument ``?foo=value``, then the value is passed to the other server
